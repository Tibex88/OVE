the Space Shuttle was designed as a
cost-effective way of making travel to
low-earth orbit routine but the promise

6
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,100
of cheap and easy access to space had

7
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,100
unexpected consequences

8
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,830
during the 1960's while NASA was

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,440
striving to reach the moon a feasibility

10
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,330

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,330

15
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,790
and return to the ground landing like a

16
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,950
plane was touted as an economical

17
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,330
alternative to disposable rockets

18
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,090
concepts for a space plane had been

19
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,950
around since the 1950s but most of these

20
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,780
had been little more than drawings

21
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,720
backed up by a modest set of

22
00:01:51,780 --> 00:02:00,330
calculations in the early months of 1972

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,180
a formal agreement was signed and NASA

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,850
began work on a reusable space launch

25
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,370
system that became known as the space

26
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,170
shuttle a fleet of four shuttles was

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,240
planned and they would all be named

28
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,460
after famous ships

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,790
however an extra shuttle to be used as a

30
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:25,370
test craft was completed first it was to

31
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,130
be named the Constitution after the

32
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,620
famous u.s. naval frigate but fans of

33
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,570
the TV show Star Trek petitioned the

34
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,570
government to call it the enterprise

35
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,610

36
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,160
rolled out from the plant in Palmdale

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,830
California Star Trek fans were there in

force fortunately there had been several

39
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,690
real ships named the enterprise so the

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,290
administration relented and the new name

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,290
stuck

42
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,500
compared to the space capsules in which

43
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,870
astronauts had previously returned to

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,840

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:04,949

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:11,620
NASA modified two 747s to carry the

enterprise to varying altitudes for a

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,680
series of approach and landing tests

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,290
with no engines it had to glide to a

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,660
landing but gliders alight with long

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,920

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:50,520
19 minutes in the air when Columbia the

59
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,920
first space worthy shuttle left the

the new system it would drastically

62
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,400
reduce launch costs and there would be a

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,650
new mission every week but there were

64
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,770
critics that felt this was far too

65
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:10,260
optimistic veteran astronaut John Young

66
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,110

tested with a crew on board Young was

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,720
instrumental in convincing NASA that

72
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,880
Columbia's first flight should not be a

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,700
test of the very risky abort maneuver

74
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,680
that required the shuttle to flip and to

voyage in April 1981 it had been almost

79
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,979
six years

00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,979

Columbia's first flight and the

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:07,370
subsequent three missions were all

84
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,479
designed to test the orbiter in space

85
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,790
modifications will be carried out based

86
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,790
on what was learned during these flights

87
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,600
the crew reported that insulating tiles

88
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,120
on an engine pod had dislodged the craft

89
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,070
was covered in thermal tiles to protect

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,169
it during the heat of reentry problems

91
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,169
with tiles would be an ongoing issue

Columbia returned to a safe landing and

93
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,750
though this first shuttle mission was a

94
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,030
success

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,430
the orbiter had extensive tile damage

96
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,910
and one of the undercarriage doors and

97
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,910
buckled

98
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,300
shockwaves at launch were responsible

99
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,300
for some of the damage and the pad would

100
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,160
be modified but clearly the tiles were a

101
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,860
vulnerable part of the design and

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,289
preparing the orbiter for reuse would

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:08,150
take longer than expected a new method

104
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:10,190
for attaching the tiles was introduced

105
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:18,169
and engineers were confident other

106
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:20,240
difficulties could be overcome it took a

107
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,490
hundred and three days for NASA to

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,440
prepare the spacecraft for its second

109
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,690

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:33,979
with a large external fuel tank painted

114
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,180
flights all had two-man crews

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,800
vital components in the new space

116
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,040
transportation system were the two solid

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,810
rocket boosters the shuttle program

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,730
marked the first use of solid fuel

00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,730
rocket for human spaceflight

120
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,510
unlike the liquid fueled main engines

121
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,330
these boosters could be stored with a

122
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,370
full propellant load but once farewell

123
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:55,530

124
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,530
burned until their fuel was exhausted

125
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,570
they were then jettison

126
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:11,349
and just like the shuttle these boosters

127
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:13,629
were designed for reuse waiting off the

parachutes pumped out the water and

135
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:43,969

refurbishment after Columbia's second

with intentionally damaged areas did not

143
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,740
lead to failure and lesser concluded

144
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:10,149
that the safety factor for this

145
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,149
component was large enough

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,089
the remaining two launchers in the

147
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,579

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:29,060
was continually improved this was the

152
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,060
last change to its appearance

153
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,790
these test flights verified the shuttles

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,100
ability to cope with on-orbit thermal

155
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,470
stress and allowed the crew to gain

156
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,990
experience with the robot arm but there

157
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,910
was also a secret military aspect to one

158
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:06,830
of these missions that sat awkwardly

159
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,830

modifications to NASA's original design

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,980

the 4th 1982 the spacecraft was declared

165
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:29,790
operational this meant it could start

166
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,670
earning its key and NASA had big plans

167
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,560
for its new launch system but some were

168
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,160
arguing that things were happening too

00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,220
to continue its study of solar flares

192
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,130
but astronauts had been training for a

193
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,170
unique repair mission nothing like it

194
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,760
had been attempted but NASA was keen to

195
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,860
develop the new techniques but the

196
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,860
shuttle system was making possible a

197
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,520
completely new device that allowed

198
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,290
astronauts to fly freely had been built

199
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,480
NASA had plans for a space station that

200
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,790
would require complex construction

201
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,280
techniques and the manned maneuvering

202
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,010
unit was seen as an important new tool

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,380
for astronauts to master the repair of

204
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,380
solar max was its first proper task

205
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,150
however capture of Sola max did not go

206
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,330
smoothly with mission specialists George

stabilized by ground controllers than

210
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,400
the next day using the robot arm sole of

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,330
several instruments had failed and it

214
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,880
took two mission specialists to separate

215
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:08,560
spacewalks to complete the intricate

216
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,360

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,640
astronaut mounted on the end of the

218
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,150

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:29,260
it could equal the accuracy of the

224
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,690
so successful that new Earth orbiting

ease of maintenance though the new space

227
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,700

236
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:50,439
in 1984 there were five shuttle missions

in 1985 with Atlantis completing the

the deployment of satellites but there

242
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,059
were some missions like the Space Lab

243
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,679
that were dedicated to science

244
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,649
specifically the study of weightlessness

245
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:14,239
on the human body

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:16,129
this soreness are entering into a

partnership with the European Space

250
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,290
that the Soviet space program was

251
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,049
planning the launch of an orbiting space

252
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,699

00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:39,110
had begun planning its own space station

256
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,829
but money for this project was not

257
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,829
materializing

258
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,800
in January 1986 a crew of seven was

preparing for the launch of Challenger

260
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,810

generally warm climate conditions

262
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:00,380
leading up to the launch had been frigid

launch facilities had frozen during the

264
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,760

265
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:09,500
though some voices were urging caution

266
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,540
they were overruled the crew was to

also determined that NASA management had

297
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,200
a tendency to exaggerate reliability to

298
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:52,200

first interplanetary probe to be

important part in the process but a new

atmosphere had started in 1979 but

371
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,750
delays in its construction had led to

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:59,120
delays in its launch date it became

373
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,160
known as the Hubble Space Telescope and

374
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,890
just one of its unique design features

375
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,440
was the hinged protecting panels that

376
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,350
had door handles it was designed to be

377
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,549
maintained in space and only a space

378

shuttle could do that

April 1990 and the astronomy world held

380
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:26,550
its breath finally the most ambitious

381
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,980
most expensive telescope ever built was

382
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,900
on its way to space and the scientific

383
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,179
breakthroughs from such a clear view of

384
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,179
the cosmos were expected to be human

385
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,640
discovery had a crew of five including

386
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:45,230
pilot Charles Bolden who went on to

387
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,230
become the administrator of NASA

388
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:53,460
discovery climbed to its highest orbit

389
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:56,190
to datum 612 kilometers the higher orbit

390
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,750
would ensure Hubble's longevity apart

391
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,910
from a small problem with its solar

392
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,280
panels the deployment of the telescope

393
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,530
went smoothly NASA and its European

394
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:10,650
partners were hoping it would remain in

395
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:12,420
service for at least 15 years the first

396
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,640
pictures from Hubble were blurred and

397
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,400
ground staff started adjustments to

398
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,230
fine-tune the instrument but in weeks it

399
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,110
was apparent that there was a flaw in

400
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,870
the primary mirror Hubble became a

401
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:30,960
laughingstock the most expensive piece

402
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:32,700
of space junk ever soon plans for an

403
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,680
elaborate mission to fix Hubble or

404
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,990
underway and the space shuttle was an

405
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:41,880
essential part of a mission designed to

406
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:44,010
turn a disaster into a triumph but

407
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,160
nobody was really sure if it would work

408
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:59,640
or even if it was possible
